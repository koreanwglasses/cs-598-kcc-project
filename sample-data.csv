You can avoid these PIDs by grepping them away based on the script's name. It is stored in , so

Another (safer) way would be to grep away the script's PID. It is stored in :

We need to escape the  here so it isn't interpreted by the shell but by . That command means:
If the line contains  and does not contain  and does not contain our very own PID, then print the second column.
The advantage is (in theory) that this runs faster because only one additional command () is required as opposed to 3 greps and an awk.

"I am trying out LXD. It seems the default way to set up networking is to have the host provide DHCP and NAT for all the guests, but I'd like to omit NAT and allow the guests to use the same DHCP server as the host. This seems like it should be a pretty reasonable thing to want, but I can't get it working. No matter what I do, the guest never gets an address assigned by the external DHCP server.
To make things harder, it looks like LXD's network configuration changed pretty majorly with LXD 2.3, and the vast majority of information I find out there is for earlier versions. I did find this one GitHub issue where someone was trying to do the same thing and posted a new-style configuration that worked for them, but it didn't seem to make a difference when I tried it.
So, the question is, How do I set up a bridge in LXD 2.3+ without NAT and using external DHCP?
Here is some additional detail:

Ubuntu 18.04 with LXD 3.0.0
Host uses interface enp10s0f0
Want to bridge guests to interface enp10s0f1 (which is not otherwise used by the host)
Additional interface enp1s2 unused

Note that this is just my current configuration attempt for ; I've tried many:


Update:
I have been playing with this more and it's leaving me even more confused. I'm getting seemingly very erratic behavior. Is this still kind of new and flaky, or am I just doing stuff wrong? For one thing,  doesn't seem to work:

I've also created a second bridge to test two configurations at once, and I can set them very similarly to a NAT+DHCP configuration (not exactly the same because unset isn't working) yet only the original interface gets assigned an address. I can't figure out why the new interface can't get an address at all. Notice the similar IPv4 configuration:

Yet, in the container, eth0 works (connected to lxdbr0) and eth1 never gets an address (connected to lxdbr1):

Gets index files from the repository and processes them (the same process as ).
Downloads files from collected index files, if they do not exist locally. The folder structure is preserved in this process (similar to ).

For more detailed information about how  works and for confirming that it is impossible to partially mirror the repository to get latest versions only, you can refer to The Source code of apt-mirror (Written in Perl).
So, what to do to get latest versions from large repositories?
My temporary workaround for your situation (taking for example,  repository for Ubuntu 18.04 - Bionic):

Enter the path for mirroring:

Open and comment every line in : 

Add your desired repository(ies) for mirroring:

I tried to use top to see what was going on, but under the circumstances it wouldn't run.
The older thread on this topic suggested two possible causes: rtkit misbehavior and buffer overflow. But it offers no information about determining which is the cause and what to do about it. Naively looking at the log, it seems to me that rtkit isn't the culprit; it's merely responding to something else going on.
In fact, that older thread is almost useless, except for explaining the ""canary"" reference.  If the problem is indeed a buffer overflow, how does knowing that help anyone? Indeed, it doesn't even tell you what system component is misbehaving.  And for anyone other than a knowledgeable system maintainer, knowing what is misbehaving still isn't helpful.
As to rtkit-daemon, that doesn't look like a prime causality either -- and if it is, what can anyone do about it?
Further addendum:I suspect that the cause might be Dropbox hogging bandwidth.  So using Dropbox's bandwidth setting, I've throttled back the upload bandwith that Dropbox can use.  Time wil tell if that makes any difference.

NOTE: This may duplicate information from , however in discussion with them, the aforementioned individual suggested posting an 'authoritative' answer as I have worked with this exact issue/question before.

The behavior witnessed in your environment is the  equivalent of what  on pre-18.04 was doing.  The  updates affect the nameservers that  use for its lookups.  This is detailed in the last section of the answer.
But first, for the curious, some history about this behavior, and how it differs from the 'older' Ubuntu versions which use Network Manager and .  (Feel free to skip past the next section of this answer if you only want the 18.04-related stuff)

Before 18.04:  as a local caching resolver
Prior to 18.04, whenever you used the GUI Ubuntu, it would install  alongside Network Manager.  The Network Manager integration with  would update the  list of 'next hop' servers (upstream DNS servers) for where to send a query.
Therefore, a DNS query for  would pass from whatever application is requesting the resolution, into , and if  doesn't know the IP address or has had a cached entry expire, would then pass the DNS request to whatever upstream DNS server (for this example,  or ).  You would then have to check Network Manager or the  config to see where the 'upstream' DNS servers were.
This is typical behavior in a graphical Ubuntu installed from the Desktop ISOs.
The default install from the Server ISOs, conversely, followed the traditional ""update "" method via the  package and utilized  directly instead of communicating via .

18.04: , and 
With 18.04, the default DNS system is .  This operates like the  of old does, except it does this for both Desktop and Server ISO installations currently.  It also can integrate with Network Manager (used in the GUI environments for managing wifi and such), and with Netplan (which better handles ethernets)
 is handed from  (servers or custom desktops) or Network Manager (default Desktop images) the list of DNS servers to send queries to (whether statically configured or configured via DHCP).  Therefore, using the same example from above, a DNS query to  would pass through 's stub resolver which would either return the cached lookup value or pass it on to upstream DNS servers.
This emulates the default behavior of , but also adds some additional lookup handling for how 'localhost', and other local-related addresses can be queried.
With NetPlan, or Network Manager, you can get the list of upstream DNS servers through  with the following command:

which will give you a bunch of output.  The relevant section would look like this (taken from 's answer for expediency):

"Disclaimer: This is a well-educated guess and not a canonical, documented answer.

Any application I've tried uses the /etc/resolv.conf nameservers.

On my 18.04 system, the un-commented, that is, actually operational, section of /etc/resolv.conf says:

That is, I believe, a symptom of the use of dnsmasq, the system that caches DNS information. That means, I believe, look in the local cache first, before asking external nameservers.
But the local cache won’t contain any nameserver information about a website that has never been visited before. In that case, the system uses declared external DNS nameservers. These may be declared in /etc/network/interfaces in older systems; in /etc/netplan/*.yaml in newer systems or, in almost all desktop installations, in Network Manager. 
In fact, /etc/resolv.conf tells us how the external nameservers can be found.

Run ""systemd-resolve --status"" to see details about the uplink DNS servers currently in use.

On my system, the report says, in part:

In short, I believe that DNS nameservers are declared in netplan to tell the system where to look if the DNS information is not found in the local cache.

Navigate to the folder which contains the zip-folder, extract it.
In the terminal direct the command line into the extracted folder location (which ends with /qbirthday-master) with

cd >extracted folder's location<

In older Ubuntu versions, python 2.7 is the default for pip, you have to install pip3:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

And then install Qbirthday (being still in the folder's location):

pip3 install qbirthday

I had to restart the computer to be able to use Qbirthday from the command line.
If you want to see the indicator in the panel, you may have to install or activate the GNOME extension gnome-shell-extension-appindicator:

One click on the indicator icon: Reveal indicator menus upon.
Double clicking an icon will activate the application window.

You have to probably create a desktop-file (see other answer) with the content to be able to use it from a launcher:
[Desktop Entry]

And place it in the folder , make it executable.
Adding it to the Startup Applications is also handy, just qbirthday as new entry.
PS: Two issues were found, maybe somebody can help to solve them:

Pop-up window from panel indicator/icon too much to the left, not fully visible, see also launchpad bug report.
Workaround: Reduce the numbers of displayed birthdays in the preferences until the window is not anymore too tall for the screen and the window is fully visible.
Double click needed to open birthday list
Maybe the Qbirthday app can be forked to be a Gnome extension. At the moment there is no working birthday gnome extension.

"There is no evidence that I am aware of that the driver included by default in kernel version 4.4.0-xx is outdated, nor that instability can be rectified by installing a different, maybe older, maybe newer driver. Moreover, I know of no driver that actually compiles and installs.
Instability is sometimes caused by problems in the router such as auto channel select and others. 
Please check the settings in the router. WPA2-AES is preferred; not any WPA and WPA2 mixed mode and certainly not TKIP. Second, if your router is capable of N speeds, you may have better connectivity with a channel width of 20 MHz in the 2.4 GHz band instead of automatic 20/40 MHz, although it is likely to affect N speeds. I also have better luck with a fixed channel, either 1, 6 or 11, rather than automatic channel selection. Also, be certain the router is not set to use N speeds only; auto B, G and N is preferred. After making these changes, reboot the router. 
Next, I recommend that your regulatory domain be set explicitly. Check yours:

If you get 00, that is a one-size-maybe-fits-all setting. Find yours here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 Then set it temporarily:

Of course, substitute your country code if not Iceland. Set it permanently:

"for testing purposes I often use Android x86 VMs in Virtualbox (I know they're not officially supported, but they work fine). Until recently, I had Virtualbox 5.1.34 and Ubuntu (Mate) 17 and everything worked fine.
Now I performed an update of my distro from 17 to 18.04 and together with that, Virtualbox updated to 5.2.10.
Whenever I want to run an Android x86 VM (I don't have any other systems), it boots (or loads when I run it from a restored snapshot) fine but after a few seconds it crashes (the window closes and the state of the VM in the menu is Aborted). This happens to my old VMs as well as some new VMs I tried to make.
I tried to read the log of a VM that crashed, but I don't really understand what to look for. I pasted it here on pastebin. The log is from Android 6.0 (64bit) that booted normally (no snapshot).
I tried to downgrade my Virtualbox back to 5.1.34, but  says that the only version available for my system is 5.2.10. After trying to downgrade manually, Virtualbox complains that some kernel modules have a wrong version and I cannot fix it.
Is there anything I can do to get my VMs working? Or do I just have to wait for an update for Virtualbox and hope it's going to solve my problem?

Copy the launcher for Calculator (probably named ) from  and paste to .
Open the copied file using a text editor.
Look for a line beginning with . If there is one, append  to it. Otherwise add the following line 

Append the following lines to the end of the file and save it.

Thanks to all who responded. The netplan config yaml configures the nameservers after I do this:

I made the mistake of switching the User Session Defaults in Mount Options to off then back on for that drive. That can mess with your distribution.
I fixed it by going back into Disks and checked for certain that I was using the User Session Defaults first. Then I quick formatted the drive again. Once I remounted the drive with my file manager again it was all cleared up. Everything was back to usual.

"If the guest is Linux, there is one option not mentioned often that may improve speed a lot if meet the requirements.
You can tell VirtualBox to use a USB disk inside the guest, and if the guest is a Linux system, it can use such a disk for root, though maybe not for boot (VBox refuses to boot from USB).
Also you can tell VBox to use such a disk as RAW (warning: with host accessing the disk at same time, if host is Windows you had better set disk as offline). I dislike this a lot; I prefer to pass a USB drive.
But ensure the USB drive is fast (better if an SSD) and USB is 3.x (better if 3.1 Gen2), USB 2.0 is a real bottle neck.
In this way the Linux guest will control the real hardware (through USB pass) and that can make the guest really smooth.
Also think about using Linux Live systems (that run full in RAM), but have plenty of RAM (like 32GiB/64GiB/128GiB/256GiB/.../1TiB of RAM on Host).
Nothing actually beats RAM speed.

My configuration is a 128GiB AMD ThreadRipper 1950X (16 cores/32 threads) with 128GiB of DDR4 and eigth 120GiB SSD (each 500MiB/s) in LVM2 (stripped).
On boot the Linux system copies its 2GiB Host Linux into RAM (from an SSD like RAID 0 in less than two seconds), then host is running fully from RAM, then I copy the Guest disks to RAM drive (64GiB copied on less than nine seconds) and then I run VBox and start the Guest, and the guest disks are fully on RAM.
So all (host and guest) runs with all disk storages on RAM (faster disk access while running is impossible with any physical disk).
I know, I allow only 30GiB for host and guest as RAM, for host I give 6GiB and guest 24 GiB.
So my 128GiB are used as this (number with * indicate approximated):

2GiB* of RAM Drive for Linux host (disk to ram boot)
6GiB of RAM as host RAM (for host system and apps)
64GIB of RAM Drive for Guest virtual (fised size) disk
128MiB of RAM for guest video memory
